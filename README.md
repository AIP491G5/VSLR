## Model Architecture

### HGC-LSTM Overview

The HGC-LSTM (Hierarchical Graph Convolution + Long Short-Term Memory) model is specifically designed for sign language recognition tasks. It combines the spatial modeling capabilities of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with the temporal sequence learning power of LSTM networks.

![Model Architecture Overview](docs/images/model_overview.png)

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)

The GCN component models the spatial relationships between human joints using an adjacency matrix that represents the skeletal structure:

![GCN Architecture](docs/images/gcn_architecture.png)

**Key Features:**

- **Adjacency Matrix**: 75×75 matrix representing connections between pose, left hand, and right hand keypoints
- **Normalized Graph Convolution**: Applies spectral graph convolution with symmetric normalization
- **Multi-layer Processing**: Multiple GCN layers for hierarchical feature extraction
- **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizes training and improves convergence

**Mathematical Formulation:**

```
H^(l+1) = σ(D^(-1/2) A D^(-1/2) H^(l) W^(l))
```

Where:

- `A` is the adjacency matrix with added self-connections
- `D` is the degree matrix
- `H^(l)` is the feature matrix at layer l
- `W^(l)` is the learnable weight matrix
- `σ` is the activation function

#### 2. Temporal Attention Mechanism

The temporal attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant time steps in the sequence:

![Temporal Attention](docs/images/temporal_attention.png)

**Process Flow:**

1. **Linear Transformation**: Input matrix is linearly transformed
2. **Tanh Activation**: Non-linear activation for feature enhancement
3. **Attention Weight Computation**: Softmax normalization creates attention weights
4. **Weighted Aggregation**: Element-wise multiplication and sum reduction

**Implementation:**

```python
attention_weights = F.softmax(self.attention_linear(torch.tanh(linear_out)), dim=1)
attended_output = torch.sum(input_matrix * attention_weights, dim=1)
```

#### 3. Joint Attention Mechanism

The joint attention mechanism focuses on the most discriminative joints for each gesture:

![Joint Attention](docs/images/joint_attention.png)

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Spatial Focus**: Identifies important body parts for each gesture
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Learns to emphasize relevant joints dynamically
- **Feature Enhancement**: Improves discriminative power of joint features

#### 4. LSTM Temporal Modeling

Long Short-Term Memory networks capture temporal dependencies in sign language sequences:

**LSTM Features:**

- **Bidirectional Processing**: Captures both forward and backward temporal dependencies
- **Hidden State Management**: Maintains long-term memory for sequence modeling
- **Gradient Flow**: Addresses vanishing gradient problem in long sequences

### Complete Pipeline

The complete HGC-LSTM pipeline processes sign language videos through the following stages:

1. **Keypoint Extraction**: MediaPipe extracts 75 skeletal keypoints per frame
2. **Graph Construction**: Keypoints form a graph structure with predefined adjacency matrix
3. **Spatial Processing**: GCN layers model spatial relationships between joints
4. **Temporal Processing**: LSTM networks capture temporal dynamics
5. **Attention Aggregation**: Dual attention mechanisms focus on relevant features
6. **Classification**: Final layers predict sign language classes

### Model Configuration

The model architecture is highly configurable through the config system:

```python
# Model dimensions
config.model.input_dim = 2          # (x, y) coordinates
config.model.hidden_dim = 128       # Hidden layer dimensions
config.model.num_gcn_layers = 3     # Number of GCN layers
config.model.num_lstm_layers = 2    # Number of LSTM layers
config.model.dropout_rate = 0.3     # Dropout for regularization
```

## Features

### Data Augmentation

The new augmentation system uses a simple array configuration:

```python
# Available augmentations: 'flip', 'translation', 'scaling'
config.data.augmentations = ['flip', 'translation', 'scaling']  # All augmentations
config.data.augmentations = ['flip']                            # Only horizontal flip
config.data.augmentations = ['translation', 'scaling']         # No flip (for sign language)
config.data.augmentations = []                                 # No augmentation
```

**Augmentation Options:**

- **Horizontal Flipping**: Left-right hand/pose swapping with semantic preservation
- **Translation**: Random position shifts while maintaining relative joint positions
- **Scaling**: Random size changes with aspect ratio preservation
- **Stratified Splitting**: Balanced train/validation sets ensuring class distribution

### Advanced Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for real-time inference
- **Robust Detection**: Handles various lighting conditions and backgrounds
- **Coordinate Normalization**: Automatic scaling and centering of keypoints

#### Attention Mechanisms

- **Dual Attention**: Both temporal and spatial attention mechanisms
- **Adaptive Pooling**: Dynamic feature aggregation based on gesture complexity
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights provide model interpretability

#### Graph Neural Networks

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Multi-level graph convolution for different body parts
